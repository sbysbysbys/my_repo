Civil rights groups issue travel warnings against Missouri

Due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks in Missouri, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored (NAACP) issued travel warnings to people of color who were going to Missouri for a trip.

The NAACP Missouri Travel Consultation, which came into effect on August 28, 2017, calls for all African American travelers, tourists, and Missouri residents to pay special attention and adopt an extremely cautious attitude when traveling in Missouri due to a series of suspected racial incidents in the state. This is to inform you, "the group's statement declared.

NAACP pointed out that a recently passed Missouri law has made it more difficult for people to win discrimination lawsuits, and state law enforcement has also targeted minority groups to some extent, which has prompted the organization to issue travel warnings.

Violations of civil rights are happening to people.

They were stopped for questioning, beaten or killed due to their skin color, "Missouri NAACP Chairman Rod Chapel told The Kansas City Star.

We have received many complaints, an unprecedented number

This is the first such warning issued by the organization against a certain state in the United States.

The organization cited the racial defamation of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28 year old black man Tory Sanders in Tennessee.

Earlier this year, Sanders died under suspicious circumstances. He ran out of fuel while traveling in Missouri and was detained by Missouri police without charge of crime.

The consultation also pointed out that a recent report from the Missouri Attorney General's Office showed that "compared to white people, black drivers in the state are 75% more likely to be parked for inspection.

Chapel said, "This consultation is aimed at raising people's awareness and warning their families, friends, and colleagues about possible situations in Missouri

People need to be prepared, whether it's carrying bail to Missouri or letting relatives know they're traveling within the state.

According to the latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015; According to the number of crimes, the state ranks 16th in the country.

The travel warning is also a response to the new Missouri law, which will make it more difficult to sue enterprises for housing or Employment discrimination.

Previously, the US states passed immigration law enforcement laws, requiring local law enforcement authorities to detain immigration offenders. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said this would increase the number of racial lawsuits, and issued travel advice for Texas and Arizona.

Travel warnings are usually issued by the US government against other countries, but recently, consulting groups have adopted this approach to address certain laws and trends within the US.

After experiencing the "golden age" of skyrocketing box office in 2015, the overall film market entered a calm period in 2016, and whether it can break the total box office record of 44.069 billion yuan last year has become a mystery.

According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, in October, the prices of new and second-hand houses in Beijing both cooled down, rising only 0.6% and 1.1% month on month.

BBC calls Beijing the Most Exciting City: Making Foreigners Feel 'Living in a New Era'

According to a report by British media on January 18th, Beijing may have a long history of 3000 years, but it is also rapidly transforming into today's modern and charming city.

This Chinese capital has an astonishingly fast internet, cutting-edge technologies such as facial recognition software, huge investments in artificial intelligence, and unparalleled international energy. It is one of the most exciting cities for explorers.

According to a report on the BBC website on January 16th, German expatriate Clemens Seech said, "If I can succeed there, I can succeed anywhere in the future." He quoted the lyrics of singer Frank Sinatra singing about New York City.

If Sinatra had lived to this day, he would probably have sung about a city like Beijing, "said Seth, who serves as the creative director at Traveler Archives magazine. He said that living in this city would make you feel" living in a new era "and always keep up with trends.

Simon Norton, who comes from England but recently lives in Beijing, wrote on his personal blog website 4Corners7Seas: "People generally have a feeling of being at the center of something grand, which is difficult to articulate, but it keeps many foreigners there for a long time. They want to see what it will become and want to witness it firsthand

The report states that the city's high-quality high-speed internet and technology friendly environment make daily life easier than ever before.

Andy Pennafuert, from Manila and currently serving as the deputy editor in chief of the "Beijing Children" website, said: "Beijing is rapidly transforming into a cashless society, where the internet integrates the functions of traditional wallets into smartphones, making it easier for everyone to make many transactions

According to the report, smart phones are just the beginning of Beijing's technological ambition, and facial recognition software has become very popular. Many mobile phone applications use this technology to make bank transfers and payments, let people enter apartments and offices, and even use it to verify the identity of Ridesharing company drivers.

Beijing also recently announced that it plans to spend 13.8 billion yuan to build an artificial intelligence technology park. After completion, more than 400 enterprises will settle down there. They will focus on developing various artificial intelligence technologies, from biometrics to autonomous vehicle.

Food is also the core of many major festivals in China over the years, and participating in these celebrations is highly praised by foreigners. The Spring Festival is the most important social and economic festival, and also one of the easiest festivals for foreigners to participate in.

I suggest helping Chinese friends prepare for the Chinese New Year by cleaning their apartments and posting red Spring Festival couplets with New Year's greetings on their doors. On New Year's Eve, all family members should gather together for a sumptuous meal, and then stay up until midnight to welcome the New Year with bright and loud fireworks. For foreigners, spending this night with friends and family is indeed an opportunity to integrate

The report states that the number of foreigners in Beijing is numerous and constantly increasing, but the language barriers in China and the convenience of communication between overseas Chinese can easily become excuses for them not fully integrating into the local culture.

Some foreigners have been living in China for many years, but have little experience with their host country. If your initial attempts to meet Chinese people are not successful, then you easily feel that it is easier to get along with other foreigners.

‚ÄùIn these so-called "foreigner bubbles", foreigners gather in their own communities, eat at Western restaurants, and have only foreigners among their friends.

The simplest way to overcome this is to learn a little Mandarin - it's easier than people may imagine.

Saying, "Attending one or two hours of private Chinese language classes or learning entry-level radio dramas every week should be suitable for everyone's busy schedule

Even learning a few classic short sentences can be helpful for shopping, ordering at restaurants, or chatting in taxis.

The report states that stubborn air pollution is also a fact in daily life, but in recent years, the government has made efforts to curb some problems.

Residents emphasize the importance of outdoor activities during warm months when pollution is often light, and consider those blue sky days as opportunities to wander through historic alleys or explore the popular Ritan Park.

Norton said, "Beijing is the Chinese city that can discover the most things below the surface. You can find great art and music activities, indulgent nightlife, historical wonders, ultra modern commercial areas, and ancient hutong areas

The report believes that the hindering effect of aging on human capital growth is increasingly evident, especially in the Northeast region, where the annual contribution rate of aging to human capital growth is -1.28%.

Pan Gongsheng pointed out that at present, the risk of cross-border capital flow is controllable, and the fundamental factors supporting the balance of international payments still exist for a long time.

China News Network, Beijing, December 17 (Reporter Gao Kai) The world shines because of its heritage - The 2016 International Summit Forum on the Appraisal, Restoration and Conservation International of Chinese Ancient Calligraphy and Painting was opened at Renmin University of China on December 17.

The European Commission accused Google in April of forcing mobile phone manufacturers to pre install software such as Google Search and Chrome browser, otherwise they would not be allowed to use other Google applications.

The European Commission believes that this move is detrimental to consumer interests and hinders competition.

EU regulators initially requested Google to respond before July 27th.

If convicted of antitrust charges, Google faces a maximum fine of 10% of its global revenue, approximately $7.4 billion.

Google has not immediately commented on this.

Google is also facing an investigation from the European Union for favoring its own shopping services in search results.

Zhang Yuning's stay abroad was down-to-earth, and it can be said that his "leap" from national youth to national Olympics was not accidental, and the extent of his rapid growth is still surprising.

Understanding Bitcoin's legal status around the world through a picture

Abstract: In addition to the natural price correction caused by speculative properties, the current round of digital currency's tragic decline is also related to the "old enemy" - regulatory risks.

From the visual map, it can be seen that Eastern countries have a more conservative attitude towards Bitcoin compared to the West, and the countries that dominate the world are still watching the legitimacy of digital currencies, representing a significant "black swan risk".

*This article is from Wall Street Insights (WeChat ID: wallstreetcn), edited by Wang Mu. For more exciting information, please log in to wallstreetcn.com or download the Wall Street Insider app*

With regulatory storms brewing in major Bitcoin markets such as China, South Korea, and the European Union, global digital currencies led by Bitcoin have been severely affected this week. Bitcoin prices have fallen below the psychological integer of $10000 since Tuesday, marking their largest daily decline in three years.

In addition to the price correction naturally triggered by speculative properties, the current round of digital currency's tragic decline is also related to the long-standing "enemy" - regulatory risks.

At this important juncture, the visual Big data website HowMuch.net has produced a map to show the legitimacy and supervision of Bitcoin in countries around the world.

As shown in the figure below, green represents the legitimate market for Bitcoin; Orange represents a neutral market, and although Bitcoin's status has not yet been publicly legalized, there are no major usage restrictions; Light pink represents a restricted market, where local governments attempt to use digital currency through red line policies or regulations; Dark pink represents a country where Bitcoin is defined as illegal; Grey is a country that has not yet commented.

(The above image was drawn by the HowMuch. Net visualization team on January 15th)

The article points out that from the distribution of non green color blocks in the figure, it can be seen that in the traditional sense, Eastern countries have a more conservative attitude towards special coins than Western countries.

Russia is currently the largest country to define Bitcoin as illegal, China is one of the largest restricted markets for Bitcoin, and India is one of the largest countries to not comment on Bitcoin and have not yet introduced relevant policies.

North America and Western Europe have the highest acceptance of Bitcoin, with a more concentrated distribution of green blocks.

The views of countries in the Middle East and Latin America on the special currency show significant differentiation, and the distribution of color blocks in these regions is more mixed.

Iraq, Iran, T√ºrkiye and Brazil are all legal bitcoin markets. Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bolivia and other countries have some restrictions on their transactions and use. More Latin American countries have not yet made a sound of bitcoin.

Based on the above data, it can be seen that out of the 246 countries surveyed globally, a total of 99 countries (or 40%) do not impose restrictions on the trading and use of Bitcoin, namely green and orange regions.

7 countries (or 3%) are restricted markets (light pink), 10 countries (or 4%) define Bitcoin as illegal (dark pink), and 130 countries (or 53%) have not yet treated digital currency information more (gray).

This indicates that countries, which account for 53% (over half) of the global majority, are still watching the legitimacy of digital currencies led by Bitcoin within their borders, and also represents that Bitcoin's "black swan risk" remains high, as some of these countries may ultimately make legislative decisions to restrict digital currencies.

The article believes that global regulatory agencies have not fully understood the emerging category of digital currencies, which may be the main reason why most countries have not yet made a statement.

Although the popularity of Bitcoin has grown exponentially since last year, it does not necessarily mean that all countries are interested. Some countries may be concerned about the threat to local fiat currencies or even more concerned about the use of digital currencies by criminal organizations.

Wall Street has written a detailed summary of international regulatory news on Bitcoin since last week, including China's crackdown on centralized online platforms and mobile apps for over-the-counter exchanges, South Korea's consideration of closing the digital currency exchange, and the EU's perception that Bitcoin has not been widely accepted and warning investors of the risk of "losing everything".

The editor in chief of Wall Street News's selection "Reading Highlights | 2018: Global Central Banks Opening the First Year of Digital Currency?" mentioned that from any perspective of regulation, acceptance/criticism, and adoption, 2018 will become the first year of digital currency for global central banks.

The criticism of Bitcoin's legitimacy by major powers such as Russia is actually aimed at making way for the official issuance of digital currency.

Madrid, January 8th (Xinhua News Agency) (Reporter Xie Yuzhi) Barcelona's new signing, Coutinho, made his debut wearing a Barcelona jersey at Camp Nou on the 8th.

On the morning of that day, Coutinho passed Barcelona's medical examination and signed a contract with Barcelona President Batomeu that will expire in the summer of 2023.

Subsequently, as a Barcelona player, he made his debut in front of nearly 7000 football fans at Camp Nou.

According to Spanish media, the total transfer fee for Coutinho may reach 160 million euros (1 euro is approximately 7.77 yuan), making him the most valuable player in the history of Barcelona and La Liga.

Due to the current injury to Coutinho, he still needs to rest for nearly 20 days to make his debut wearing a Barcelona jersey.

What else is sacred?

Now Trump's White House is aiming at the Statue of Liberty

The most definite sign of regime change is when they began attacking statues.

Americans, like anyone else, agree with this. Therefore, in 2003, Saddam Hussein at Paradise Square in Baghdad? Hussein was carefully planned and pushed down.

Stephen? As one of the key think tanks of the Trump government, Stephen Miller has been working with Jim? When Jim Acosta had a heated debate on the President's proposal to strictly restrict legal immigration, he must know what would happen if he cut a symbolic axe at the Statue of Liberty.

To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.

If he did this, a group of cruise ship owners and followers of liberalism would surely devour him alive.

But he did attack the significance of the statue, especially in 1903, Emma? The significance of Lazarus' famous poetry when it was engraved on a pedestal (this monument was not completed until 17 years later).

As Miller scolded Acosta, he said: "I don't want to talk about all the facts of history here, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of American freedom illuminating the world.

The poem you are referring to was added later, not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "

In fact, Miller is right, but as he himself said, this is not really about history.

This involves the modern echo of Lazarus of Bethany 'words of surprise. The only country seems to invite not only any old immigrants, but also the poorest of the poor: "Your fatigue, your poverty, or your crowded people desire to breathe freely,/the suffering people refuse your crowded beaches."

There is no moment when 'suffering people refuse' becomes more dazzling on our screen.

Miller did not engage in literary criticism, and he made it clear that these people would not be popular in the Trump era of America.

This conflict over the meaning of statues is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is actually a conflict with the American spirit.

Lazarus, along with her friends who held events after her death to inscribe her poetry on the pedestal, are well aware that the actions they are participating in are highly political.

The purpose of this sculpture is to express the connection between French and American Republicanism through the ancient classical metaphor as the female incarnation of the Statue of Liberty.

Lazarus of Bethany changed this meaning: in her poems, the female image is no longer abstract, she wants to speak.

She gave herself a very different name: Mother of Exile.

The combination of this poem and this painting is a successful feminist coup and a devastating blow to American nationalism.

Just as Lazarus of Bethany changed the meaning of the statue, the right-wing always wanted to change it back.

The Great Speaker Rush? Rush Limbaugh, a temporary baptist from Trump, believed in 2010 that liberalism did not invite anyone, but he is now an early Neoconservatism, bringing the flame of American wisdom to the ignorant world: "The Statue of Liberty is brave.

Her original intention was to bring the torch of freedom from the United States to other parts of the world.

The torch is not the path that illuminates America

Unusually, Limbo was actually moved by something.

The meaning of a statue completely depends on the perspective of cognition.

Lazarus of Bethany's most imaginative way is to be able to see it. When tired, poor, but hopeful people can see it on the deck of a ship after a long and often terrifying journey.

On the surface, this involves the perspective of those who seek asylum and have the opportunity to improve their lives on the world.

Her statue conveys to them and requires them to hear the original intention of hope and welcome.

Of course, this is not the viewpoint that Miller and Trump once wanted to acknowledge.

Their torches are not meant to illuminate the path, but to ignite hatred from their only source of power.

In 2006, Sa Dingding joined Universal Records with his unique music style, becoming the first Chinese to sign a contract with Universal's UK headquarters.

2017 World Championships: Neil? Neil Black highly praised the Scottish players in the British national team

Arid? Eilidh Doyle recalled that there were only two Scots in the British national team at that time.

Neil, Executive Director of the British Athletics Association? Blake stated that the team consisting of 16 strong Scots in the group stage of the World Championships will make a significant contribution to the 'national team'.

The number of Scottish athletes selected to participate in the 2017 London Athletics World Championships, which opened on Friday, has reached a record high.

Blake believes that 'Scotland is making extraordinary progress' and British track and field athletes must learn from it.

We accept and try to understand this, and we will persevere until we achieve success, "Blake said.

I'm talking to the personnel from the Scottish Institute of Sports. They think it's related to their actions.

Scottish track and field athletes believe that this is related to their actions.

The British Athletics Association believes that this is related to their actions.

Even street people think so.

Regardless of the situation, this is extremely brilliant. ‚Äú

Several Scottish track and field athletes are medal contenders, including Laura? Laura Muir and Andrew? Andrew Butchart, they will compete with Mu at 5000 meters? Mo Farah competes high and low, while Arid? Eilidh Doyle was selected as the team leader.

Arid is a bit humble.

Her captain's speech is really unbelievable, "Blake said.

Many track and field athletes, whether they are Scottish or not, or wherever they live or train, walk out of their houses with pride and enthusiasm.

Arid's natural passion and genuine emotions are very good

The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at his fifth World Championships, stated that there are 16 Scots in the UK national team, which is "unbelievable".

Previously, the maximum number of Scottish track and field athletes participating in the World Series was 7, that is, the number of participants in 1983 and 2015.

Middle distance runner Muir is a leading figure. In the past year, she has set five UK records and two European records.

She will participate in the 1500 and 5000 meter events.

Chris, who competed in the 1500 meter event? O'Hare is another noteworthy Scottish player who has previously achieved good results in the season, winning both the UK national qualifiers and the Olympic Anniversary.

Doyle recalled that she participated in the first World championship, when the only other Scot in the team was Lee? Lee McConnell.

The captain said that she is deeply proud that so many of her compatriots have not only joined the team, but in some cases, they will also challenge for medals and compete to reach the finals.

The special thing about becoming the captain of the national team is that it is elected by the votes of other members of the national team. Therefore, it is a great honor for me to know that your teammates vote for you to strive for an extremely unusual achievement, no matter what, "she added.

Of course, I am very proud of all the Scottish players.

This only indicates how far we have come.

And they are all veteran track and field athletes here, approaching the goal of winning the podium.

How was my captain's speech?

Well, I think it's great.

I just referred to the fact that in this situation, we are very lucky because we are hosting the World Championships at home.

Therefore, it is really important for us to rely on home support and grow up by returning to the Olympic Stadium.

I will have a second chance to participate in the competition, and the atmosphere there will be fantastic

Blocking Critics on Facebook: If you can't tolerate the criticism of voters, don't run for public office

Our founding father understands the style of bad media.

Americans all love Washington, but soon after, major newspapers began to fiercely criticize him for everything from domestic policies to political principles.

He is very angry at these criticisms, without a doubt.

But he did not silence these critics.

Because as early as 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech is deprived - we will be slaughtered like lambs in silence and ignorance

This reminds me of Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland, who needs to learn from Washington.

Hogan's staff blocked and deleted at least 450 posts as they expressed their views on his official Facebook page.

The American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week.

The governor's staff believed that the lawsuit was very hasty, and online reports were filled with their strong resistance: "Who cares

Many people say, 'This is just Facebook.'

But this is important.

This is particularly important because facing people like Hogan.

This is a Republican who serves as governor in a state with a democratic majority, and he is surprisingly popular.

Among the 50 governors in the country, he received the second highest praise.

Hogan is not a reactionary and impatient person.

He manages Maryland smoothly and strictly follows the rules.

He is also very good at using Facebook as the main way to connect with voters, jokingly displaying his baldness after chemotherapy on the homepage for the first time.

So blocking people who come to the governor's homepage for comments is completely unnecessary and ultimately very dangerous. This homepage is a public forum, which is an official management platform advertised by employees who pay taxes and support the public.

In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan's spokesperson, Amelia Shas, defended the governor's actions by saying that she believed blocking their comments was just a way for them to restrain themselves.

But they hastily describe it as a raging beast or cynic sweeping the internet.

The Washington Post has had face-to-face conversations with people blocked by Hogan.

They are just ordinary people talking to their chosen leaders: their identities are teachers, small business owners, and pastors, not just beasts of war.

They all expressed that their comments were profound, respectful, and not vulgar.

The pastor quoted words from the Bible in his post, calling on Hogan Ming to remember his Catholic faith.

Lakshmi Salma Lamani, a barrister in Bowie, Maryland, is not cynical, but she asked about hate crimes.

She wrote in the news story review section of the Washington Post, 'I politely commented that I am disappointed that he did not respond to hate crimes and other recent news events.'.

I also don't like a group of people commenting on the same topic, because these people will be directly ignored by some people, thinking that they are a so-called herd mentality, rather than treating them as a group of citizens who are concerned about the country and the people

The so-called "dense spam bombing" by the governor's staff may be seen by others as a "persistent advocate".

The Facebook era has made it easy to modify a message by blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.

And it is also much cleaner than in the past. In order to achieve the same effect in that era, it was necessary to send staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical comments, or to arrest or silence protesters.

But that is indeed what is happening now, but on a digital level.

Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of silencing others on Facebook and other social media.

President Trump is being sued by Twitter users because he blocked them on Twitter.

Last week, a landmark ruling emerged in Virginia regarding such issues.

According to James C. Carcharis, a district judge in Alexandria, the chairman of the Lauden County Supervisory Committee's act of blocking voters from her Facebook page violates the First Amendment.

Governor of Kentucky Governor Matt Bevan (R) was also patronized by the American Civil Liberties Union for his use of Facebook and Twitter.

This shouldn't be so difficult.

In the Washington era, affordable postage had a similar impact as the internet.

The number of news newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and some wrote anonymous letters fiercely criticizing his leadership.

And even at that time, Washington had anonymous threats against him.

People use pseudonyms such as Yurikla, Valerius, Belisarius, and Bogus to write letters to the newspaper to severely criticize Washington's decision.

According to the Historical document collected by the online project of George Washington Newspaper, his office was flooded with petitions, criticizing his attitude towards the Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation between His Majesty the King of England and the United States of America signed with the United Kingdom.

But he did not silence them.

Freedom of speech, dissent, and speech are the foundation of this country.

And true leaders need to accept this.

The slightest disturbance in the real estate market is affecting people's sensitive nerves.

Purchase restrictions are a hard lever in many urban real estate regulation policies.

In May 2017, Jinan issued regulations that undergraduate students who have continuously paid social security for six months can enjoy the same purchase policy as local permanent residents;

In June, Wuhan issued a policy stipulating that college students can settle down with their graduation certificate and employment certificate within 3 years after graduation.

Subsequently, the policy was increased, and the official stated that "college students can buy a house at a price 20% lower than the market price";

In July, Chengdu issued regulations that young talents with bachelor's degree or above from other universities can apply to settle in Chengdu with their graduation certificate.

In addition, cities or regions such as Kunshan and Shanghai Lingang have also introduced policies related to "talent introduction" to lower the threshold for talent to purchase houses and settle down.

Zhang Hongwei believes that this is actually a competition among major cities for population, especially talent. Retaining population, especially talent, is what makes cities competitive, which is the most important significance of these real estate policies.

Some people even believe that this means that the time has come for the "purchase restrictions" in the real estate market to be lifted.

Director Er Dongsheng said on the same day that the shooting plan has a long history. The first time to adapt the script was in 1999, and he even planned to find Takeshi Kaneshiro to play Yan Shisan.

The Southport athlete said: "This is really very special.

I didn't defend my title at the Extremadura Open, because the game was canceled the year after I won.

It feels amazing to come to this place,

Playing golf here is very wonderful.

Last year's memories have emerged one by one, and for me and my wife Sharon, last year's victory has special significance for us.

That was really a special memory, and we will always remember it

Returning to his hometown for the competition is Gary Orr, who turned 50 earlier this year and also participated in the European Evergreen Tour.

This is his first time participating in a Scottish tournament since the 2013 Scottish Open.

Orr from Helensburgh said: "There will always be more significance in returning home to compete,

I really enjoy being able to compete again, I have been playing golf.

I am very satisfied with the current situation

On the 22nd, Zou Shoumin, Director of the Environmental Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China, introduced in Beijing that in August, a total of 57 consecutive daily punishment cases were implemented nationwide. The new revision of the Environmental Protection Law implemented earlier this year significantly increased China's environmental law enforcement efforts.

At present, environmental protection agencies in various parts of China can use daily continuous penalties, lockdowns, production restrictions, and administrative detention to investigate and punish environmental violations, and cooperate with judicial authorities to punish environmental crimes.

According to Zou Shoumin, in August, a total of 335 cases of seizure and detention were implemented across China; A total of 177 cases of production restriction or suspension were implemented; A total of 189 administrative detention cases were transferred, and 166 suspected cases of environmental pollution crimes were transferred.

Among them, Henan has implemented 7 consecutive daily penalties, and currently, China is comprehensively strengthening environmental pollution control from terminal control to full embedding.

Although the downward pressure on the economy is evident, the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China has previously made it clear that China should correctly handle the positioning of environmental protection in economic development, strengthen its "green fixation", and the more economic growth slows down, the more it cannot relax environmental protection, and play a good role in optimizing the economy through environmental protection.

There is no maximum, only higher. Kweichow Moutai's share price can't stop on the road to a new high.
